Test iOS application

Requires iPad with iOS 6+ and internet connection. 

Tested on ios simulator only sice my dev licence expired.

Time spent: ~16 hours. Can't say exactly. Started on Friday late evening and finished on Monday. 
Please take into account usual working hours in between.

Application listens to 9999 port:
In terminal run the following command:

````telnet <device_ip_address> 9999```` 

Then type whatever you want to search and hit enter. See the result on the iPad screen.
